# UI Path Examples

These are examples I created while learning about UI Path


## HTML Screen Scraper

This scrapes a copyright right engine for a simple search then puts the results from the table into an Excel file.

## PDF Scraper

This downloads a PDF and extracts text, then writes it to a file.

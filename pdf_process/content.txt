About the National Science and Technology Council
The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) is the principal means by which the Executive
Branch coordinates science and technology policy across the diverse entities that make up the Federal
research and development enterprise. A primary objective of the NSTC is to ensure that science and
technology policy decisions and programs are consistent with the President's stated goals. The NSTC
prepares research and development strategies that are coordinated across Federal agencies aimed at
accomplishing multiple national goals. The work of the NSTC is organized under committees that
oversee subcommittees and working groups focused on different aspects of science and technology.
More information is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/nstc.
About the Office of Science and Technology Policy
The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by the National Science and
Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to provide the President and others within
the Executive Office of the President with advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological
aspects of the economy, national security, homeland security, health, foreign relations, the
environment, and the technological recovery and use of resources, among other topics. OSTP leads
interagency science and technology policy coordination efforts, assists the Office of Management and
Budget with an annual review and analysis of Federal research and development in budgets, and serves
as a source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment for the President with respect to major
policies, plans, and programs of the Federal Government. More information is available at
http://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp.
About the Fast Track Action Subcommittee on Critical and Emerging
Technologies
The NSTC established this Fast Track Action Subcommittee in 2020 to identify critical and emerging
technologies to inform national security-related activities. In support of this work, the Subcommittee
coordinated across the NSTC and the National Security Council (NSC) to identify priority critical and
emerging technology subfields, updated no less than every two years.

CRITICAL AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES LIST UPDATE

Overview
Critical and emerging technologies (CETs) are a subset of advanced technologies that are potentially
significant to U.S. national security. The 2022 National Security Strategy identifies three national security
interests: protect the security of the American people, expand economic prosperity and opportunity,
and realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life.1 The NSTC
established this Fast Track Action Subcommittee in 2020 to identify critical and emerging technologies
to inform national security-related activities. This list identifies CETs with the potential to further these
interests and builds on the October 2020 National Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technologies, which
contains an initial list of priority CETs.2 This updated document expands upon that original CET list and
the February 2022 update by identifying subfields for each CET with a focus, where possible, on core
technologies that continue to emerge and modernize, while remaining critical to a free, open, secure,
and prosperous world. While enabling or supporting technologies are sometimes referenced, other
enabling capabilities, like a modernized, technically capable workforce, are excluded. Though certain
enabling capabilities are not explicitly included, they remain critical to the promotion and protection
of all CETs.
Though not a strategy document, this updated CET list may inform government-wide and agency-
specific efforts concerning U.S. technological competitiveness and national security. This list may also
inform future efforts to prioritize across CETs and their component subfields; however, this list should
not be interpreted as a priority list for either policy development or funding. Instead, this list should be
used as a resource to: inform future efforts that promote U.S. technological leadership; cooperate with
allies and partners to advance and maintain shared technological advantages; develop, design, govern,
and use CETs that yield tangible benefits for society and are aligned with democratic values; and
develop U.S. Government measures that respond to threats against U.S. security. Departments and
agencies may consult this CET list when developing, for example, initiatives to research and develop
technologies that support national security missions, compete for international talent, and protect
sensitive technology from misappropriation and misuse.
To generate this updated CET list, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) facilitated an
extensive interagency deliberative process through the National Science and Technology Council
(NSTC) and in coordination with the National Security Council (NSC). The responsible NSTC
subcommittee included subject matter experts from 18 departments, agencies, and offices in the
Executive Office of the President, who identified CET subfields that their home organizations determined
may be critical to U.S. national security. As such, this updated CET list, which was coordinated through
both the NSTC and the NSC, reflects an interagency consensus on updates to the 2022 CETs.
